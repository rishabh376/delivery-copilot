# Monitoring - delivery-copilot

- Prometheus scrapes `/metrics` every 15s
- Grafana dashboard: `monitoring/grafana-dashboard.json`
- Alerts include high error rate, crash loops, and latency spikes.

SLO: 99.9% availability, p95 < 250ms
Error budget: 43m/month

The platform is observability-first: metrics, alerts, and a dashboard keep the team ahead of deployment risk.
